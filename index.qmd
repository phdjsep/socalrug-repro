## Introduction

Overview of today's agenda

  - Importance of Version Control and Reproducibility
  - Dive into Git
  - Intro to `renv`
  - Working with `renv`

::: {.notes}
- Hello everyone, my name is Sep Dadsetan and I've been invited here to speak about version control and reproducibility. My main hope with today's presentation is to highlight the value that version control and reproducibility has for you, your team, and your company.

- Just a heads up that these topics can't be sufficiently covered in one hour, but what we'll attempt to do is grease the wheels and get exposed to some important concepts. 

- As a little background, my formal education is in Genetics and Molecular Physiology, but I always had an interest in programming since high school. I'm mostly self-taught, but credit many of the amazing engineers I've had the pleasure of working with. My presentation today comes from real world experience in working in and with analytics/engineering teams, so I hope to highlight that perspective.

## Section 1: Importance of Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It's a critical practice in software development and has become increasingly important in data science as well. Here's why:

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### 1. Collaboration 
Data science often involves collaboration among multiple team members. Version control systems like Git allow multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously. They can make changes, submit them for review, and merge them into the main project without overwriting each other's work.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### 2. Reproducibility 
In data science, it's crucial to be able to reproduce results. By keeping track of the exact versions of code, data, and **libraries** used, version control helps ensure that experiments can be replicated precisely. This is vital for both validation of results and for future work that builds on previous findings.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### 3. Experimentation
Data scientists often need to try out different models, features, or hyperparameters. Version control allows them to create branches where they can experiment without affecting the main project. If an experiment is successful, it can be merged back into the main codebase; if not, it can be discarded without any mess.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### 4. Accountability
Version control maintains a detailed log of who made what changes and when. This is essential for understanding the evolution of a project and can be crucial for regulatory compliance in some industries.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### 5. Backup and Recovery
Mistakes happen, and code can be lost or broken. Version control acts as a continuous backup, allowing you to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. This can save hours or even days of work.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### 6. Code Quality
Through code reviews and the ability to track changes over time, version control can help maintain and improve the quality of the code. It encourages best practices and helps prevent "code rot" where code becomes unmaintained and outdated.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### 7. Integration with Other Tools
Version control systems often integrate with other tools used in data science, such as continuous integration systems, project management tools, and code notebooks. This can streamline workflows and make the entire process more efficient.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### Summary
Version control is not just a tool for software developers. It's an essential part of modern data science, enabling collaboration, reproducibility, experimentation, and much more. By providing a structured way to manage changes, track history, and integrate with other tools, version control systems like Git help data scientists work more efficiently and effectively.

## Git Concepts - Simplified

Imagine you're working on a big puzzle with your friends, and you want to make sure that you can always go back to see how the puzzle looked at different stages. Version control is like taking a picture of the puzzle every time you add a few pieces.

Here's how it works:

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
(**Repository**) - Starting the Puzzle: When you first open the puzzle box, that's like starting a new project. In version control, this is called creating a "repository." It's the place where all the pictures of your puzzle will be stored.

![](images/puzzle-box.jpg){height=500 fig-align="center"}
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
(**Commits**) - Adding Pieces: Every time you and your friends add some pieces to the puzzle and are happy with how it looks, you take a picture. In version control, this picture is called a "commit." It's a snapshot of how everything looks at that moment.

![](images/puzzle-in-progress.jpg){height=500 fig-align="center"}
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
(**Branches**) - Trying New Things: Sometimes, you might want to try putting together a part of the puzzle without messing up what you've already done. You can take the current picture and make a copy to work on. This is called a "branch." If you like what you've done in the branch, you can add it back to the main puzzle. If not, you can just throw that copy away.

![](images/puzzle-branch.jpg){height=500 fig-align="center"}
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
(**Collaboration**) - Working with Friends: Version control lets you and your friends work on the puzzle together without getting in each other's way. You can all take turns adding pieces and taking pictures, and if someone makes a mistake, you can always look at the previous pictures to see what went wrong.

![](images/puzzle-in-collab.jpg){height=500 fig-align="center"}
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
(**History**) - Going Back in Time: If you ever want to see how the puzzle looked at any earlier stage, you can look at the pictures you've taken along the way. This is the "history" in version control, and it lets you go back in time to see how things have changed.

![](images/puzzle-history.jpg){height=400 fig-align="center"}
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
(**Backup**) - Keeping Everything Safe: If something happens to the puzzle, like if your little sibling messes it up, you still have all the pictures you've taken. You can use those pictures to put the puzzle back the way it was.

![](images/puzzle-backup.jpg){height=500 fig-align="center"}
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
So, version control is like a magical camera for your projects. It lets you take pictures of what you're working on, try new things without worry, work with friends, and even go back in time if you need to. It's a way to make sure that you can always see how your puzzle—or your project—has grown and changed.

## Section 3: Introduction to Renv

- Explanation of Renv - what it is and why it's needed
- Important concepts

![](images/renv_hex.png){.absolute top=425 left=1300 width="300"}

## What is `renv`?

> The renv package helps you create create reproducible environments for your R projects.

`renv` is like a special container for your R project (equivalent to `virtualenv` in Python). 

Imagine you have a toy box, and for each new project, you want to use different sets of toys without mixing them up. 

`renv` helps you create a separate toy box for each project, ensuring that the toys (or in this case, the R packages and versions) don't get mixed up between different projects.

## Why is `renv` needed?

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### **1. Isolation**
Just like you wouldn't want your puzzle pieces to get mixed up with your building blocks, you don't want different R projects to use different versions of packages. `renv` keeps everything separate, so one project's packages don't interfere with another's.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### **2. Reproducibility**
If you want to show your friend how you built a cool toy castle, you need to make sure you have the exact same building blocks and instructions. Similarly, `renv` ensures that anyone who wants to run your R code can do so with the exact same packages and versions, so they see the same results you did.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### **3. Simplicity** 
Managing all the different toys (packages) for different projects can be confusing. `renv` makes it easier by handling all the details for you. It's like having a toy organizer that knows exactly where everything goes.
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top=400}
### **4. Collaboration**
If you're working on a project with friends, you all need to have the same toys to play together. `renv` helps ensure that everyone on the team has the same setup, so you can all work together smoothly.
:::

## Important `renv` concepts

- Libraries
  - A **library** is a directory containing installed packages.
  - These have different "levels" that they can be installed in:
    - System
    - User
    - Project
  - Tip: Can view with `.libPaths()` command in R console.

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
- Repositories
  - A **repository** is a source of packages
  - `install.packages()` has to go and grab the package from somewhere on the internet (usually CRAN) and puts it into your library.

## Section 4: Working with Renv

- Installation and setup of Renv
- Demonstration (time permitting)

![](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.png){.absolute left=500 width=1000 height=700}

## Install and Setup `renv`

1. Install the `renv` Package

First, you'll need to install the renv package from CRAN. Open R or RStudio and run the following command:

```
install.packages("renv")
```

2. Load the `renv` package

Once the package is installed, you can load it into your R session with:

```
library(renv)
```

3. Intialize `renv` for a Project

Navigate to the directory of your R project (you can do this within RStudio or set the working directory in R), and then run:

```
renv::init()
```

This command will create a new isolated environment for your project. It will generate a `renv.lock` file and an renv folder, which contain information about the packages and versions used in the project.

## Install and Setup `renv`

4. Managing Packages with `renv`

Once renv is initialized, any packages you install or remove will be specific to that project. You can use standard commands like `install.packages()` or `remove.packages()`, and renv will manage them within the project's environment.

5. Sharing and Reproducing the Environment

If you want to share the project with others or move it to a different system, the `renv.lock` file contains all the information needed to recreate the environment. Someone else can clone the project and run:

```
renv::restore()
```

This command will install all the packages and versions specified in the `renv.lock` file, ensuring that the project's environment is reproduced exactly.

## Let's get our hands dirty...again

Let's install `renv` into our recipes repository to add some isolation and improve our reproducibility.
